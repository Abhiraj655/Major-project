  <h1>What is C Programming</h1>  
 <ul class="liste1">
   <li> C is most popular and widely used computer programming language. It was developed by Dennis Ritchie in 1972 at the Bell Lab.</li>
    
   <li>It is used to develop system application software.</li>
    
   <li> There are various UNIX application developed in C language like OS, Compiler and many more.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>History of C language:</h2>
  <ul class="list2">
    <li>C was started as a UNIX program Bell Lab.Dennis Ritchie was the founder of C Language.

      
    <li>      C language is the successor of B and BCPL Language. It was formalized in 1988 by ANSI (American National Standard Institute).
    </li>
    <li>      The current stable version of C language is C11 and released in December 2011.</li>
  </li>
    <li>C was originally developed for UNIX operating system to beat the issues of previous languages such as B, BCPL, etc.

    <li>      The UNIX operating system development started in the year 1969, and its code was rewritten in C in the year 1972.</li>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Features of C Language</h2>
  <ul class id="list3">
    <li>It is easy to learn.</li>
    <li>      It is system programming Language.
    </li>
    <li>      It can handle low-level activities.
    </li>
    <li>      It is a procedural language.
    </li>
    <li> It has rich libraries etc.</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Classification of Computer Software:</h1>
  <p class id="parg1">Software is a set of instructions, data or programs used to operate computers and execute specific tasks. It is the opposite of hardware, which describes the physical aspects of a computer. Software is a generic term used to refer to applications, scripts and programs that run on a device. It can be thought of as the variable part of a computer, while hardware is the invariable part.</p>
<h2 class id="hed1">There are mainly three types of computer software:-</h2>
<ol class id="list4">
  <li>System Software</li>
  <li>Application Software</li>
  <li>Utility Software</li>
</ol>

<h2>System Software:</h2>
<p class id="parg1">These software programs are designed to run a computer's application programs and hardware. System software coordinates the activities and functions of the hardware and software.</p>
<p class id="parg1"> In addition, it controls the operations of the computer hardware and provides an environment or platform for all the other types of software to work in. </p>
<p class id="parg1">The OS is the best example of system software; it manages all the other computer programs. Other examples of system software include the firmware, computer language translators and system utilities.</p>
<p class id="parg1">Some examples of system software are Operating System, Compilers, Interpreter, Assemblers, etc.</p>

<h2>Application Software:</h2>
<p class id="parg1">The most common type of software, application software is a computer software package that performs a specific function for a user, or in some cases, for another application</p>
<p class id="parg1">An application can be self-contained, or it can be a group of programs that run the application for the user.</p>
<p class id="parg1">All the apps that we see on our mobile phones are also examples of Application Software. There is certain software that is exclusively made for app development like Meteor and Flutter. </p>
<p class id="parg1">Examples of Application software: − Payroll Software,Student Record Softwar, Income Tax Software, Railways Reservation Software,  Microsoft Office Suite Software,  MS Word,  MS Excel,  MS PowerPoint.</p>
<h2>Programming Language:</h2>
<ul>
<li class id="list3"><p class id="parg1">A programming language is a computer language that is used by programmers (developers) to communicate with computers.</p></li>
<li class id="list3"><p>It is a set of instructions written in any specific language ( C, C++, Java, Python) to perform a specific task.</p></li>
<li class id="list3"><p> A programming language is mainly used to develop desktop applications, websites, and mobile applications.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Types of Programming Language:</h3>
<h4>There are mainly 3-Types of programming language:-</h4>
<ol class id="list4" >
  <li>Low level Programming language.</li>
  <li>Middle level programming language.</li>
  <li>High level programming language.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Low level programming language:-</h2>
<p class id="parg1">Low-level language is machine-dependent (0s and 1s) programming language. The processor runs low- level programs directly without the need of a compiler or interpreter, so the programs written in low-level language can be run very fast.</p>
<p class id="parg1">Machine language is a type of low-level programming language. It is also called as machine code or object code.</p>
<p class id="parg1">Machine language is easier to read because it is normally displayed in binary or hexadecimal form (base 16) form.</p>
<p class id="parg1">It does not require a translator to convert the programs because computers directly understand the machine language programs.</p>
<p class id="parg1">The advantage of machine language is that it helps the programmer to execute the programs faster than the high-level programming language.</p>
<h2>Assembly  language(Low level programming language):-</h2>
<p class id="parg1">Middle-level programming language lies between the low-level programming language and high-level programming language.</p>
<p class id="parg1">It is also known as the intermediate programming language and pseudo-language.</p>

<p class id="parg1">A middle-level programming language's advantages are that it supports the features of high-level programming, it is a user-friendly language, and closely related to machine language and human language.</p>
<h2>High level programming language:-</h2>
<p class id="parg1">High-level programming language (HLL) is designed for developing user-friendly software programs and websites.</p>
<p class id="parg1">This programming language requires a compiler or interpreter to translate the program into machine language (execute the program).</p>
<p class id="parg1">The main advantage of a high-level language is that it is easy to read, write, and maintain.</p>
<p class id="parg1">High-level programming language includes Python, Java, JavaScript, PHP, C#, C++, Objective C, Cobol, Perl, Pascal, LISP, FORTRAN, and Swift programming language.</p>
<h1>Algorithms:</h1>
<p class id="parg1">Algorithm is a step – by – step procedure which is helpful in solving a problem. If, it is written in English like sentences then, it is called as ‘PSEUDO CODE’.</p>
<p class id="parg1">An algorithm is a well-defined sequential computational technique that accepts a value or a collection of values as input and produces the output(s) needed to solve a problem. </p>
<p class id="parg1">An algorithm is a well-defined sequential computational technique that accepts a value or a collection of values as input and produces the output(s) needed to solve a problem. </p>
<p class id="parg1">Algorithm is a step-by-step procedure, which defines a set of instructions to be executed in a certain order to get the desired output.</p>
<p class id="parg1">Algorithms are generally created independent of underlying languages, i.e. an algorithm can be implemented in more than one programming language.</p>
<p class id="parg1">An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure that defines a set of instructions that must be carried out in a specific order to produce the desired result.</p>
<p>Example of Algorithm: <br>
  Step 1 − Start  <br>

Step 2 − declare three integers x, y & z  <br>

Step 3 − define values of x & y  <br>

Step 4 − multiply values of x & y  <br>

Step 5 − store result of step 4 to z   <br>

Step 6 − print z  <br>

Step 7 − Stop
</p>

<h1>Flowchart:</h1>

<p class id="parg1">A flowchart can be defined as a diagrammatic representation of an algorithm, a step-by-step approach to solving a task.</p>
<p class id="parg1">A flow chart is a graphical or symbolic representation of a process. Each step in the process is represented by a different symbol and contains a short description of the process step.</p>
<p class id="parg1">The flow chart symbols are linked together with arrows showing the process flow direction.</p>
<p class id="parg1">They are widely used in multiple fields to document, study, plan, improve and communicate often complex processes in clear, easy-to-understand diagrams.</p>
